this is the notebook of changes made to the mimic project, specifically the two python files in the main directory - 

Changed the mortalitiy_labels_predicttion file to a more concise and robust program - added function definitions for impute_missing_values() and get_nn_data() to mock missing features. Modified the train_neural_network() function to include dropout layers for regularization and to accept scaled input data. Added scaling of input data using StandardScaler() to ensure features are on the same scale. Used fmin() from hyperopt to perform hyperparameter optimization for the neural network model. Defined a dictionary params_space to specify the search space for hyperparameters in Bayesian optimization. 
Removed the sys and os import statements since they were not used. Updated the code to use Adam optimizer instead of SGD as it tends to perform better for deep learning models. Adjusted the code structure for readability and clarity, while also adding comments when needed. In the original code the model architecture was fixed with a specific number of dense layers and neurons, while in the modified code, the model architecture is flexible and can be adjusted based on the optimal hyperparameters found through Bayesian optimization. 
These changes allow for a more flexible and potentially more effective neural network architecture tailored to the specific problem at hand.

Regarding the main file - This modified script enhances the original by introducing a few changes that improve the code. First and foremost, it implements hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization, allowing for the automatic selection of optimal model hyperparameters. This process enhances model performance by efficiently searching the hyperparameter space and identifying configurations that yield superior results. Additionally, we see functions for plotting ROC curves and confusion matrices, providing visual insights into the model's performance. 
These visualizations enable a more comprehensive understanding of the model's ability to discriminate between classes and identify potential areas for improvement. Next, the model architecture is enhanced by incorporating dropout layers, which mitigate overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of neurons during training. This regularization technique improves the model's generalization ability and prevents it from memorizing noise in the training data.
The script also streamlines the data preprocessing and model evaluation process, making the code more concise and readable. By organizing the code into modular functions and adhering to best practices, such as using lowercase for Keras optimizer names, the script becomes more maintainable and easier to understand for future development and debugging.
Thus these changes and enhancements collectively contribute to a more optimized and effective modeling workflow, resulting in improved model performance, interpretability, and scalability.
